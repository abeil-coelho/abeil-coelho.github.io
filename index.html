    <p>The research focused on data quality in cultural heritage collections, emphasizing semi-automatic diagnostic evaluation of cultural objects managed by the Brazilian Institute of Museums (Ibram). With the increasing digitization and availability of cultural heritage data, data quality is often overlooked, affecting indexing, search, and information retrieval. The study proposed using the Cataloging Cultural Objects guide to evaluate data quality in Ibram-managed museums. A semi-automatic diagnostic evaluation application was developed using Python and regular expressions. The methodology employed applied research, which was quali-quantitative, exploratory, and descriptive. The results revealed cataloging problems in Ibram collections. The developed application can be used by different users to assess the quality of their databases' data and direct preventive and corrective actions.</p>
